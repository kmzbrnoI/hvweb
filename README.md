# Public webpage with list of engines & users in hJOPserver

## Deployment

 1. `$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kmzbrnoI/hvweb`
 2. Optional: setup virtualenv.
 3. Install Python packages from `requirements.txt`.
 4. Add directory with engines to `lok`, add link to hJOPserver's `data` into `data` directory.
    - The directory is usually aÂ symlink to `lok`/`data` subfolder of `hJOPserverConfig`
      repository. The repository is either somewhere else in your filesystem or
      you can clone it to `hvsrepo` directory in this repository (this folder
      is gitignored). This is suitable for deployment.
 5. `$ make all`
 6. Serve webserver in `build` directory.
 7. Remake when database changes.

### Github autodeploy on push

 * Add deploy token to `build/deploy-token.php`.
